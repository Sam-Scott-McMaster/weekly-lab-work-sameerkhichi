The C programming language is quite similar to another language I have a considerable amount of experience in, Java. I personally like Java better as it is a more structured language, though it's syntax is not exactly simple, it makes more logical sense than C. One of the main advantages of using C is that it write code that is fast and reliable and that is not offered by every language. The reason I like java better though is that it has object-oriented programming functionalities which C doesnt, making construction and destruction of variables simpler. I much perfer java for its simpler syntax and more modular and intricate programming style.
