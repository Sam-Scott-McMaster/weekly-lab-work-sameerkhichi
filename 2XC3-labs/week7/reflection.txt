Using pointer arithmatic can be useful and very efficient as it doesnt have to reevaluate the address of each element on every access, this makes things faster and easier to use. The only downside to using pointer arithmatic is that it can be really hard to read, and that makes it harder to understand. This makes it hard to maintain and fix the code if there should be an error.I prefer pointers as they make the code easier to write and more efficient as long as I dont make any syntax errors. Indicies I tend to mess up a lot as it sometimes can be difficult for me to picture the idexes in my head.
