The top three things that I have learned includes how to manage directories within the linux software using text editor vim. Additionally I have learned how to create a path to a directory so that I can access its files without having to gointo said directories. Finally I learned how to manage text files/bash scripts using vim.

I am most excited to learn how to create projects inside the linux software and learn how to access and modify later.

I am most worried about falling behind $while trying to perfect every small detail $in my work.
