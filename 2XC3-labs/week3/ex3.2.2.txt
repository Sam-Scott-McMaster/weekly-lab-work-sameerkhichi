a. The script listed essentially takes the first argument entered after calling a file or script.
the command you would have to use to run the ls -l command using the script given, assuming the name of the executable 
file is di is: ./di.sh "ls -l"

b. the following would be sent to the stdout: "a 1 a1C 1*10" 
The reason the last varibale D, doesnt actually multiply the variable value of 1 by 10 is because the variable D holds a STRING value of "1" not an integer value.
